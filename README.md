Following along with the tutorial in Node Beginner by Manuel Kiessling, this application will be a Node.js server app that contains an image uploader and the ability to display that image in a web browser.

Serving of web pages will be done using an HTTP Server
We will use a Router to map URL requests to request handlers
Request Handlers will accept and process the requests
There may also be POST data coming to the router and that will be sent to the request handlers after using Request Data Handling
In order to display content from the server, we need View Logic to send content to the browser
When the user uploads an image, we will have Upload Handling to take care of the details of that process
